## process

### Commit 1: Initial commit
Created repository on GitHub

### Commit 2: Index
Added base html file for the project. 

### Commit 3: Page Blocking
Blocked out the sections for the webpage. 

### Commit 4: Search Bar Layout
Set up the format for the search bar section.

### Commit 5: Click to search
Started with the js and css. Have it so the term in the input is logged to the console to check that the input is working.

### Commit 6: Fetch weather data
Referencing the activities from class, I now have the code printing the weather data of the searched town to the console.

### Commit 7: Print current weather
The app now prints the current weather details except for uvi. It looks like you need to pay for uvi info?? I will ask in class.

### Commit 8: Switched to Onecall
Learned I can get uvi through onecall, so I get the lat and lon from the first pull and then pull using one call. updated all values to reflect this.

### Commit 9: Map forecast
I am now able to map the next 5 days to cards. Currently it just maps the day temp, as I just wanted to make sure everything is going to the right place.
